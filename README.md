Run "Reproduce_figures.ipynb" to reproduce the figures of the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04191v1. 
Markdown cells indicate which groups of cells must be ran in order to reproduced each figure.

Figures were originally made using python 3.8.5 with numpy 1.24.4, matplotlib 3.2.2, scipy 1.10.1, cmasher 1.6.3 and jax 0.4.6.

Follow the instructions here https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html to install jax

It should take a few days to run each Monte-Carlo simulation cell on a GPU.
